Course paper
Task:
The CMS developed during the course needs to be refined to a full-fledged website.
It is necessary to develop your personal blog site, where anyone can

to receive notifications about a new blog article.
You determine the appearance of the page yourself, but using the bootstrap v4 framework,
which we connected in one of our homework.
Documentation and components can be viewed in the attached materials.
